# Example Zoo

This is an example to manage animal from a Zoo.

The project used Test Driven Development to write the code 
on the application.

The project also uses Integration Test as part of the project
so we can assure every feature works as expected.

We can manage animal by creating, updating, deleting and searching
for an animal using the http verbs POST, PUT, DELETE and GET.
